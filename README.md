# PHSX815_Project3
## Electricity Use Analysis in my apartment.
This is just the codes from project 2 and week 8 of the homework. My goal is to generate the experiment for different value of the temperature.  \n 
Which is passed as the parameter for the parabolic distribution of the electricity consumption. Then I will calculate the temperature from the \n
simulated experiment and run the Neyman construction to compare the true value and the experimental value. Then I will use minimizer function to find the \n
value of the temperature for which the likelihood will be maximum.
-This is my goal for now. However this plan might change.
