# PHSX815_Project3
## Electricity Use Analysis in my apartment.
In this experiment we simulated the electricity consumption using parabolic distribution for given difference in outside temperature and the temperature set on thermostat.
- The main code is in the folder python. Which is named as ElectricityUse.py.
- We can simulate the code using 
- python3 ElectricityUse.py -npar <number of paramters> -Nexp <number of experiments> -Nmeas <number of measurements> -seed <seed for random numbers>. This code also utilize the Random.py to simulate random parabolic distribution for the range of x value and provided temperature as parameter.
